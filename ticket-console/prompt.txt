🤖 Hello! I'm the Network Support Agent. I've analyzed your issue and I'm here to help.

Got it — I see Acme has an in-progress ticket today for “Wi‑Fi connected but nothing works.” Let’s start by figuring out whether this is just your device (like ACME-LT-001 / ACME-WS-001) or something affecting others at your location.

Let’s try this step:

Step 1: Check whether the issue is happening on more than one device  
- On the same Wi‑Fi network, can you test one other device (phone or another computer) and see if websites/apps load?  
- Also tell me which location you’re at: Acme HQ – New York or Acme Data Center – Dallas.

Please try this and let me know:
- Did this step work? Is your issue resolved?
- Or should we continue to the next step?

Absolutely — I can get a human technician involved. While I line that up, I want to grab one key detail so we route this to the right person (Wi‑Fi issue vs site/network outage).

Let’s try this step:

Step 1: Tell me your location and whether it affects another device  
1) Which location are you at right now: Acme HQ – New York or Acme Data Center – Dallas?  
2) On the same Wi‑Fi, does your phone (Wi‑Fi on, cellular off if possible) load a website like `neverssl.com`?

Please try this and let me know:
- Did this step work? Is your issue resolved?
- Or should we continue to the next step?

🔄 I'm transferring you to our Network Support Agent who can better assist with this aspect of your issue.
